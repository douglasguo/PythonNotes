- API in Scala, java, python
- Spark streaming, MLIB machine learning, GraphX graph processing, 
- Spark core-> computation engine-> monitoring many 
- Spark offers functional programming API to manipulate ==Resilient Distributed Datasets== (RDDs)
- RDD
  - logical plan to compute a dateset
  - fault-tolerant
  - two types of operations:
    - transformation-> construct a new RDD from one or more previous ones
    - Actions-> compute a result based on an RDD and return to the driver or storage
  - linearage graph
